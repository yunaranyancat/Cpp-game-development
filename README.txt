This repo is about game development using C++.

At first, I will do the tutorials provided by wiki.planetchili.net.
The reason why I created this repository is to enhance and improve my knowledge in C++ language as well as having fun with the tutorials.
I have watched the first Chili tutorial on Youtube and I find it very useful and interactive.
